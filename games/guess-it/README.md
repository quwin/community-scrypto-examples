# Guess It: A dice roll game 

| **Note** | This example does not use the Public Tets Envirnoment and the official tools for its frontend. Instead, other tools are used to achieve similar functionality.    |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

### Objective: Guess the closest number from a dice roll
Two players will enter a game and a dice is rolled. The player with the closest guess to the actual dice roll is the winner!

### Prerequisites:
- Having fundamental knowledge of working with shell (all shell commands are prefaced with `$ [COMMAND]`)
- You should be familiar with the [Scrypto](https://docs.radixdlt.com/main/scrypto/introduction.html) coding language and the anatomy of a Radix dApp
- [Install the required toolchain](https://docs.radixdlt.com/main/scrypto/getting-started/install-scrypto.html) which will get Rust and the Radix Engine Simulator going
- Download and install an IDE of your choice with the recommended extensions:
  - VSCode: Install [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/vscode-rust) or the [Rust Analyzer](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-analyzer) extension (known conflicts running both together; using the latter is recommended more highly)
  - IntelliJ Idea: Install [Rust](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8182-rust) plugin
- Install NodeJS which comes with the Node Package Manager (NPM)
  - This is only for the front end app 
  - It is recommended to install [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) first and pull Node in through it
  - [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-stable) is the recommended package manager as it is async and builds a better dependency tree than NPM
- Install [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/download) and import the `insomnia-gameplay.json` collection file for use with testing
- Install [Revup](https://github.com/RadGuild/revup) from RadGuild to run the most basic gameplay scenario 

### Backend Setup:
- Make sure we can build and run tests successfully `$ scrypto test`
- Use `$ revup -r gameplay.rev` and make sure the final line is a success and the game's state is `"state": "Destroyed"`

### Frontend Setup:
- enter the `$ cd server/` folder and install the dependencies using `$ yarn`
- spin up the server using `$ yarn start:dev` or just `$ yarn start`
  - Troubleshoot `port in use` error: run either `$ yarn kill:unix` or `$ yarn kill:windows` to kill the running process
  - Note: Windows kill command is untested

### Gameplay:
- If you've done the frontend setup, open your browser to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
  - You will need 2 browser windows/tabs open to simulate 2 players
  - One player will create a game by clicking the "Create A Game" button
    - A prompt will appear asking you for the game name and a XRD amount you're expecting players to bet
  - Both players should be able to see this newly created game and can click on it to join
  - Once you join, the "Active Game Area" will update with the game state from the contract
  - Once both players have joined, the state will move to "MakeGuess" and a new button will appear
  - Press the MakeGuess button and enter your guess in the following prompt
  - Once both players have guessed, the dice will roll and show up in the "last roll" section of the Active Game Area and a winner will be determined
  - The player who won can then "Claim Funds" by clicking the new button that appears
    - The loser will still see the button (WIP) but cannot withdraw funds
    - If a tie happens, guesses will be reset to 0 and the last_roll will indicate that a roll has taken place
- If you chose to load the insomnia collection
  - Run `Create Player 1`
  - Run `Create Player 2`
  - Run `Create Game`
  - Run `Join Game Player 1`
  - Run `Join Game Player 2`
  - Run `Make Guess Player 1`
  - Run `Make Guess Player 2`
  - Run `Withdraw - Player 2 success`
  - The others can be run at your behest
    - Run `Check state` to view the current contract state
    - Run `Withdraw - Player 1 fails` to see the failure response

### To Do:
- There is no refund mechanism in case players choose to exit the game
- Only one round can be played per contract and the state moves to "Destroyed" and no other actions are available
- Scrypto 0.4 is set to release and have better frontend integration
