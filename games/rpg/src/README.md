# How does Substradix Work?
To summerize:

1. Character data is an NFT
2. Item data is an NFT
3. Character levelup stats are stored as a HashMap
4. Stage data is stored as a HashMap

Substradix is designed to be modular: most new additions can be done without requiring old method to be removed from use.
